It's pretty awesome to work in Beverly Hills because no matter who I talk to from around the world, the city name alone is enough for them to recognize the place. Based on what I've heard, the name recognition stems from movies, tv shows, and tourism. But how did our city get its now iconic name?

Beverly Hills founder Burton Green selected the name because of fond memories of Beverly Farms, an outlying neighborhood of the city of Beverly, Massachusetts. Mirroring the history of Beverly Hills, Beverly Farms began as a farming community and morphed into an enclave for the well-to-do. But from whence did Beverly get its name?

Beverly, Massachusetts is commonly believed to have been named after Beverley, United Kingdom. Beverley's name came from an old English term for either "Beaver Lake" or "Beaver Clearing".
